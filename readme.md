# klardotsh's zmk-config

This is my personal [ZMK firmware](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/)
configuration, based in decent amounts on the works of
[urob](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config) and
[kdb424](https://github.com/kdb424/sweep-zmk). It powers my "smol boards" like
[Sam Mohr's Osprette](https://sammohr.dev/keyboards) and the [HillSideView 40 +
Cirque](https://github.com/wannabecoffeenerd/HillSideView).

For the code powering my larger boards (like Corne), see [my QMK
configuration](https://github.com/klardotsh/qmk_firmware).
